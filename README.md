# titlebar-video
Plays videos on titlebars. Can also download new videos from youtube

a sample generated video is provided (bad  apple!). to generate your own video simply delete video.txt and the script will ask you for a youtube url.
note that generating video.txt may take some time, even at 10fps. i'll eventuallly get to using multithreading for this and fix the poor code (it's pretty cobbled together from old projects at the moment)
